# Android OAuth Fix Summary Script
echo "üîß ANDROID OAUTH FIX SUMMARY"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ Fixed Issues:"
echo "1. Scheme mismatch: Updated AuthContext to use 'fleet' scheme (matches app.json)"
echo "2. Added Android-specific OAuth callback handling with longer timeouts"
echo "3. Enhanced intent filters for OAuth redirects in app.json" 
echo "4. Added fallback auth/callback route for Android deep linking"
echo "5. Improved error handling for URL fragment tokens (Android-specific)"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ To Test the Fix:"
echo "1. Build a new development build: npx expo build:android --profile development"
echo "2. Install the new build on your Android device"
echo "3. Try Google sign-up from a fresh install"
echo "4. Monitor logs with: adb logcat | grep -i 'oauth\\|auth\\|fleet'"
echo ""

echo "üêõ Key Changes Made:"
echo "- AuthContext.tsx: Updated scheme from 'com.qwertyapp.clerkexpoquickstart' to 'fleet'"
echo "- (auth)/callback.tsx: Added Android-specific timing and error handling"
echo "- app.json: Added OAuth-specific intent filters"
echo "- Created auth/callback.tsx fallback route"
echo ""

echo "üí° Why This Should Fix the Issue:"
echo "- Android was failing to handle OAuth redirects due to scheme mismatch"
echo "- The callback timing was too fast for Android's intent processing"
echo "- Missing intent filters prevented proper deep link handling"
echo "- URL fragment parsing was iOS-specific, now handles Android URLs"
echo ""

echo "üîç If Issues Persist, Check:"
echo "1. Supabase OAuth settings match the new redirect URI"
echo "2. Google OAuth console has the correct package name and SHA certificates"
echo "3. Android manifest has the correct intent filters (should be auto-generated)"
echo "4. The development build includes the latest changes"
